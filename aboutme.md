I am Yige, or you may know me as Amy. I'm currently a MSc **Statistics** student at *Imperial College London*. My undergraduate studies were at *Fudan University*, where I spent four wonderful years studying **Mathematics and Applied Mathematics**. I am very good at theoretical things about maths and statistics and I am also working on strengthening my coding skills. Now, I am looking for a technical position related to data science, machine learning and deep learning. For more details, please see my [CV](https://YigeTang926.github.io/assets/cv.pdf).

I like singing, photographing, and doing sports such as table tennis, badminton, biking and swimming. I am outgoing and cheerful, and love to make new frineds. Welcome to make friends with me!
